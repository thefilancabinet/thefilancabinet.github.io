This is an podcast where I, [Daniel Filan](https://danielfilan.com/), interview guests about topics I'm interested in, with the aim of clarifying how the guest understands the topic. To give you a sense of the range, the first three episodes were about pandemic preparedness policy in the USA, God, and cryptocurrency. You can find episodes [here](/episodes/). Editing is done by Jack Garrett.

If you like this show, you might like my other podcast called [AXRP](https://axrp.net/), where I specifically interview people about their research related to AI existental risk - that is, stopping AI from killing all humans, or limiting humanity's potential in a similar way.
