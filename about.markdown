The Filan Cabinet is an interview podcast where I, [Daniel Filan](https://danielfilan.com/), interview guests about topics I'm interested in, with the aim of clarifying how the guest understands that topic.

Editing is by Jack Garrett.

The name and logo of this podcast were created by [Ben Weinstein-Raun](https://www.benwr.net/).
