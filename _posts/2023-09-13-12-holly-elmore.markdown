In this episode, I talk to Holly Elmore about her advocacy around AI Pause - encouraging governments to pause the development of more and more powerful AI. Topics we discuss include:
 - Why advocate specifically for AI pause?
 - What costs of AI pause would be worth it?
 - What might AI pause look like?
 - What are the realistic downsides of AI pause?
 - How the Effective Altruism community relates to AI labs.
 - The shift in the alignment community from proving things about alignment to messing around with ML models.
