In this episode, I chat with Alessandro ([@polisisti](https://x.com/polisisti/) on X/Twitter) about our respective experiences learning Latin (and in his case ancient Greek).

Things I probably brought up:
 - [The Ranieri-Roberts approach to learning ancient Greek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vwb1wVzPec)
 - [We need to talk about Latinitas](https://foundinantiquity.com/2024/04/15/we-need-to-talk-about-latinitas/)
 - [Legentibus](https://legentibus.com/)


Intermediate-level Greek texts:
 - There is a good series called "Reading Greek" published by the Joint Association of Classics Teachers. An example volume is "The Intellectual Revolution: Selections from Euripides, Thucydides and Plato".


Intermediate-level Latin texts:
 - The reader Alessandro used in his second-year course was the ["Oxford Latin Reader"](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Latin-Reader-Course/dp/0195212096), edited by Maurice Balme and James Morwood. However, Alessandro prefers ["Wheelock's Latin Reader: Selections from Latin Literature"](https://www.amazon.com/Wheelocks-Latin-Reader-2nd-Selections/dp/0060935065), edited by Richard A. LaFleur.
 - [Carmina Burana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana) is a collection of poems that is fairly easy and very fun to read.
 - An anthology of medieval Latin texts that Alessandro greatly enjoys is ["Reading Medieval Latin"](https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Medieval-Latin-Keith-Sidwell/dp/052144747X) by Keith Sidwell. Many of these selections are of intermediate difficulty (a few are very hard).
 - The prose works of Seneca bridge the gap between intermediate and advanced.

Dictionaries and grammars:
 - Alessandro's favourite Latin dictionary: The ["Oxford Latin Dictionary"](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Latin-Dictionary-Dictionaries/dp/0199580316/)
 - For medieval Latin: ["Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources"](https://www.dmlbs.ox.ac.uk/web/welcome.html)
   - the DMLBS is freely searchable at [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu)
 - For advanced Latin grammar: ["A New Latin Syntax"](https://www.amazon.com/New-Latin-Syntax-C-Woodcock/dp/0865161267) by E.C. Woodcock
 - Alessandro's favourite Greek dictionary: The ["Cambridge Greek Lexicon"](https://www.amazon.com/The-Cambridge-Intermediate-Greek-Lexicon/dp/0521826802)
 - ["The Greek Particles"](https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Particles-J-D-Denniston/dp/0872202992) by John Dewar Denniston is the book that's very helpful for reading Plato.
