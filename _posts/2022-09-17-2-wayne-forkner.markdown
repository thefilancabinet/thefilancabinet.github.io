In this episode, Presbyterian Pastor Wayne Forkner talks about God, Christianity, and the Bible. He answers questions such as:
 - What is 'God'?
 - Why do people talk about Jesus so much more than the Father or the Holy Spirit?
 - What is heaven actually like?
 - If justification is by faith alone and not by works, why does the Bible say "A person is justified by works and not by faith alone"?
 - How can people tell that out of all the religions, Christianity is the right one?
