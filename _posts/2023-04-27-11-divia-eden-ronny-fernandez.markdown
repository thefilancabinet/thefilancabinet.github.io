In this episode, Divia Eden and Ronny Fernandez talk about the (strong) orthogonality thesis - that arbitrarily smart intelligences can be paired with arbitrary goals, without additional complication beyond that of specifying the goal - with light prompting from me. Topics they touch on include:
 - Why aren't bees brilliant scientists?
 - Can you efficiently make an AGI out of one part that predicts the future conditioned on some plans, and another that evaluates whether plans are good?
 - If minds are made of smaller sub-agents with more primitive beliefs and desires, does that shape their terminal goals?
     - Also, how would that even work?
 - Which is cooler: rockets, or butterflies?
 - What processes would make AIs terminally value integrity?
 - Why do beavers build dams?
 - Would these questions be easier to answer if we made octopuses really smart?
