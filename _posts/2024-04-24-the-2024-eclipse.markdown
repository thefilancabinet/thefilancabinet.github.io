In this episode, I give you updates from my trip with friends to see the 2024 total solar eclipse. Questions answered include:
 - Why are we bothering to go see it?
 - How many of us will fail to make it to the eclipse?
 - Does it actually get darker during a total solar eclipse, or is that just an optical illusion?
 - What moral dilemma will we face, and what will we do?
 - Whose lav mic will mysteriously fail to work during their interview?
