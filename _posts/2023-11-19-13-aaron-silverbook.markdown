In this episode, I speak with Aaron Silverbook about the bacteria that cause cavities, and how different bacteria can prevent them: specifically, a type of bacterium that you can buy at [luminaprobiotic.com](https://https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/). This podcast episode has not been approved by the FDA. Specific topics we talk about include:
 - How do bacteria cause cavities?
 - How can you create an anti-cavity bacterium?
 - What's going on with the competitive landscape of mouth bacteria?
 - How dangerous is it to colonize your mouth with a novel bacterium?
 - Why hasn't this product been available for 20 years already?
