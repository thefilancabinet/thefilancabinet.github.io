In this episode I chat with John Halstead about whether climate change will kill us all. He thinks it won't. Topics we talk about include:
- How did the effective altruism community come to have someone dedicated to the question of whether climate change will kill us all?
- How bad will climate change likely be?
- How is the role of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere different from that of other greenhouse gasses?
- How big a volcano would have to go off to warm up the world by 10 degrees Celsius?
- How concerned should we be about climate change as a general stressor that makes other risks worse?
